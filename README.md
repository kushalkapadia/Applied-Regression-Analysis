# Applied-Regression-Analysis

### Here are 4 detailed assignments from my *Applied Regression Course*.

How the understanding of Statistics is helpful in the Data Science field has been explained with great details in these assignments. Each assignment contains a PDF file that has questions to address and another file than contains answers to those questions along with code. I've coded these assignments extensively in R.

### Concepts covered:
- Estimating any regression function and then fitting a regression line to it
- Least square estimates & Likelihood function of linear regression parameters
- Confidence interval & prediction interval
- Detaling of ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) table
- Pearson & Spearman correlation coefficient
- Histogram, Scatterplots & Transformation
- Lack of fit testing
